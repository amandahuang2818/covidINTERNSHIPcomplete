  <h1 class="text">COVID-19</h1>
<br/>
<p class="text"> The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the globe, affecting countries' economies and hundreds of millions of people's health and wellbeing. However, due to the constant changing situation, new emergence of variants, and consistent flow of new research, it can be hard to navigate through the factual versus misinformation regarding COVID-19. Now, more importantly than ever it is necessary to make science accessible to everyone, in order to make these fact-driven choices regarding our health. </p>
<br/>
<p class="text"> Specifically, scientists across the globe urge communities to get vaccinated in order to stop this ongoing public health crisis, as data indicates vaccines being safe, effective and crucial. </p>
<br />
<h2 class="text"> COVID-19: Biology 101 </h2>
<br/>
<p class="text"> COVID-19 is respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is part of the coronavirus family and was originally discovered in 2019 in China. The coronavirus family includes diseases such a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS; data from these diseases as well as years of past coronavirus research have been used to make our current COVID-19 vaccines. One distinctive feature about coronavirus are its spike proteins on the outer surface of the virus, which attaches to human cells, infects it, replicates, and spreads. Genetic changes to the virus can result in the change of the shape of these spike proteins resulting in different variants. </p>

<br/>
  <h2 >Variants</h2>
  <br/>
  <p class="text">The more COVID-19 spreads, the more difficult it may be to stop it, as new variants will develop due to mutations in the genetic code. These differences in the genetic code and in physical traits, such as resistance to treatments, result in the differentiation of one variant to another. </p>
 <br/>
  <h4 class="text">The CDC assigns variants to three groups:</h4>
</br>
<ul class="text">
  <li class="text">Variants of interest - variants which genetic traits indicate it could be more contagious, result in more severe symptoms, or be better able to evade immune responses.</l1>
<li class="text">Variants of concern - variants which are observed/detected as being more contagious, resulting in severe symptoms, having a likely chance of causing breakthroughs in vaccinated populations, and evading tests or treatments.</li>
<li class="text"> Variants of high consequence - variants which vaccines arenâ€™t effective against.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h2 class="text">Current Variants of Concern</h2>
<br/>
<h4 class="text">Delta</h4>
<br/>
<p class="text">The Delta variant was first identified in India, as a variant that would be more transmissible than previous ones.</p>
<br/>
<h4 class="text">Omicron</h4>
<br/>
<p class="text">The Omicron variant was first identified by scientists in South Africa during early November of 2021, and many are concerned that it is more contagious than the Delta variant, or any other previous variants. Due to it being discovered relatively presently it is unknown if it is more severe than other variants. However, data shows that breakthroughs in fully vaccinated individuals are possible, meaning that these individuals can still catch the Omicron variant and spread it to others. A recent study from The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that the current vaccine may be less effective against this variant and concludes that getting a booster shot will mitigate this lack of effectiveness; however, regardless of variant, being fully vaccinated prevents individuals from developing more severe symptoms. </p>
<br/>
<h2 class="text">How should we protect ourselves against new variants?</h2>
<br/>
<p class="text">Vaccines have been shown to be effective against severe reactions to a COVID infection; scientists believe that getting vaccinated will prevent severe hospitalization. Getting a booster shot will ultimately boost your immune response against these arising variants. It is also necessary that people continue to practice safety precautions such as wearing masks and frequently washing hands.</p>

<h2> Get Vaccinated!</h2>
</br>
<p> Encourage friends or family members who are on the fence to get vaccinated! It is encouraged that people sit down with close ones and have an open-minded, empathetic and understanding conversation about the necessity for vaccinations. Only together can we beat this virus. Check out the map below to see how your state is doing with being vaccinated.</p>

<h2> Take Action!</h2>
<br />
<p class="text"> Some action steps you can take in order do your part in stopping the pandemic include wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Additionally, it is more important than ever to make sure encouraging others to stay, as well as being thoughtful about the information that is being spread on social media or other media sites. Be mindful to stay informed on the pandemic through reliable sources such as the CDC or WHO. </p> 
<br />
<p class="text">If you have the means to consider donating to organizations that may need it. One example includes Get Us PPE, an organization that donates PPE to front line workers during the supply shortage. Click on the link below to see more ways on how to get involved. </p>
